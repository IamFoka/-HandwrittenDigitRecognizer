# -HandwrittenDigitRecognizer
A handwritten digit recognizer that use a Convolutional Neural Network, written on python.

## Getting Started
**First you'll need to install:**

Python  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Anaconda - It's a good environment to work with machine learning, especially with Tensorflow that we're going to use.  
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

OpenCV - A library for the development of applications in the Computer vision field.  
*using the Anaconda CMD*: `conda install -c conda-forge opencv`

Keras - Used to facilitate the creation of deep learning models on Theano and Tensorflow.  
`pip install keras`

Tensorflow - Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within Googleâ€™s AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning.

Jupyter - It's a web based interface that allows for rapid prototyping and sharing of data-related projects.  
Can be downloaded using the Anaconda Navigator.

Numpy  
`pip install numpy`

Matplotlab  
`pip install matplotlab`
